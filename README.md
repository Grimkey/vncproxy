# VncProxy
A RFB proxy, written in go that can save and replay RBS files

Still a work in progress, but the client side already includes all the required encodings
understanding the RemoteFrameBuffer protocol is important since we need to save the frameResponses with timestamps

some server code will be added shortly, with the proxying logics.
